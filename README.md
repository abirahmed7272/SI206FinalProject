# SI206FinalProject
This project implements a script that scrapes a user defined number of products across Goat.com and StockX.com (two popular sneaker resale websites). The script then scrapes product data for said popular SKUâ€™s, calculates the average sale price by size, the total sales by size, and total bids by size across the collected data. These 3 calculations are then visualized, using MatplotLib. Visualizations are additionally generated for all StockX and Goat products scraped.

Refer to "SI206 Final Project.pdf" for details about the project and instructions for the program.
